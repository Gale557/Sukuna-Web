            Malevolent Shrine (伏ふく魔ま御み厨づ子し Fukuma Mizushi?) is Sukuna's domain expansion.
            Befitting its name, Malevolent Shrine constructs an environment centered around a small, disfeatured Buddhist shrine (vaguely resembling a chinjudō) that has been distorted to instead enshrine demons. It is surrounded by dark water with bull-like skulls and horns floating on it. The roof also has horns emerging from it, along with human skulls that hang down from it. The four entrances to the shrine are formed by large, grotesque mouths, complete with humanlike teeth and tongues.[1][2] Four short, disfigured tree-like stumps with gnarled branches stand at each corner of the shrine.

Malevolent Shrine's guaranteed-hit ability relentlessly slashes apart anything until nothing but dust remains of what has been caught in the effective range, via Sukuna's two types of slashing attacks: Cleave and Dismantle, which only cease when the domain is disengaged or Sukuna is so badly injured he can not sustain the domain anymore. Sukuna can set which of the two attacks to use against specific types of targets, such as using Dismantle for inanimate objects and Cleave for subjects with cursed energy.[3]
