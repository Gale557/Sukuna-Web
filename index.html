        <p class="text-about">Ryomen Sukuna, also known as the King of Curses, 
        is one of the two main antagonists (alongside Kenjaku) of the 
        anime/manga series Jujutsu Kaisen. He is the strongest sorcerer 
        from a thousand years ago, and is known as "The King of Curses". 
        Sukuna made himself a cursed object during the Heian Era, the 
        Golden Age of Jujutsu. He is the master of Uraume, the archenemy 
        of Satoru Gojo, and one of the arch-enemies of Yuji Itadori 
        (alongside Mahito).
        Over a thousand years ago, during the heian era, Sukuna was a powerful curse user, served by an underling named Uraume. At the beginning of the story, his power is sealed in 20 wax fingers scattered throughout the world. Megumi Fushiguro traces one of his fingers to Sugisawa High School. In an attack by cursed spirits, Yuji Itadori eats the finger and becomes a Jujutsu Sorcerer, with Sukuna regaining consciousness within him.[10] Though Yuji has full control over his body, he is targeted for execution due to the danger Sukuna poses, with Satoru Gojo's patronage as his only protection.
        In a mission to contain a Special Grade Cursed Spirit, Yuji and his colleagues are greatly endangered, so the young sorcerer gives Sukuna control of his body, to defeat his assailant. Sukuna destroys the opponent, but seizes the moment of freedom to rip out Yuji's heart, and attempts to kill Fushiguro, becoming very interested in the latter. When Yuji wrestles back control to save his friend, he dies, and meets Sukuna within his soul. Sukuna offers to return Yuji to life, but persuades him to accept a deal allowing Sukuna brief control on one more occasion. Sukuna remains silent from then on, only roused by an encounter with the Cursed Spirit Mahito, in which he mocks Yuji for losing a friend.In the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is gravely injured, and the Cursed Spirit Jogo force-feeds him many of Sukuna's fingers. Sukuna, indifferent to Jogo, kills him after a very destructive battle across the city.[12] He reunites with Uraume after the battle, and states he has a plan to regain freedom. He then saves Megumi from Mahoraga, his summoned Shikigami, catastrophically razing much of Shibuya ward in the process, before surrendering control back to a traumatized Yuji.[13]
        During the climax of the Culling Games arc, Sukuna forcibly steals Megumi Fushiguro's body by feeding Megumi a finger, and fought the post-awakened Maki Zenin and Yuji Itadori, before fleeing with Uraume. To fully crush Fushiguro's spirit into submission, he kills his sister Tsumiki, who had been similarly possessed by the sorcerer Yorozu. After some time, Sukuna saves Kenjaku from being attacked by the freshly unsealed Satoru Gojo and then they agree on a duel on 24th December 2018.
        In the Shinjuku Incident Arc, Sukuna, having achieved his full power, fought Satoru Gojo in a neck to neck battle of constant Domain Clashes, with Sukuna using Mahoraga to counter Gojo's powers. Seemingly defeated, Sukuna adapts to Gojo's Cursed Technique, and kills the sorcerer. Sukuna is then challenged by another Culling Game opponent, Hajime Kashimo, who forces him to return to his true four-armed form. Yuji Itadori challenges Sukuna again with Hiromi Higuruma, the latter using his domain trying to weaken Sukuna's power by charging him of his crimes in a court case.
